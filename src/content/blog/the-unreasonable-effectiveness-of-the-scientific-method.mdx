<Slide>

## This is a diatribe

Personal opinions/thought processes lie herein

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Why is this diatribe worth listening to?

* I have a decade in software development, in teams both large and small üîü
* My specialisms are in accessibility, UX and performance engineering ‚è©‚ôø
* Good communication can (from experience) reduce employee burnout ‚ò†Ô∏è

</Slide>
<Slide>

## What is the Scientific Method?

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üëÄ Make an observation

This is an initial set of measurements to provide a summary of the status quo.

</Slide>
<Slide>
## ü§î Form a hypothesis

Begin to reason about what might need to change

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üë©üèº‚Äçüî¨ Make a change

to allow for testing the hypothesis

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üìî Conduct an experiment

Re-run the measurements from the first step, to replicate behaviours

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üßÆ Analyze the results

Did you actually answer the question?
Is there a measurable difference?

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üîÅ Repeat as needed

Often it's useful to iterate on smaller sets of experiments to reach a goal in the longer term

</Slide>
<Slide>

## "Freyja, why are you telling us this?"

üí¨ An imaginary audience member for dramatic effect, 2024

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Because this is secretly about understanding the needs of people!  ü§∏üèª

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Well... it's really about understanding systems in general... üìà

but people most importantly! ü§∏üèª

</Slide>
<Slide>

## "You don't have to be an engineer to be a racing driver, but you do have to have *Mechanical Sympathy*."

üí¨ Jackie Stewart, according to [Martin Thompson's GOTO Aarhaus 2012 talk on the concept](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MC1EKLQ2Wmg)

</Slide>
<Slide>

## What is Mechanical Sympathy? ü¶æ

A philosophy of understanding how a system works to get the most out of the system's utility

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Why is Mechanical Sympathy useful in software? üñ•Ô∏è

* It gives you an understanding on where more complex issues may be
* It gives you focus on where to improve if required to
* It provides a mechanism through which an architecture can scale to *everybody's* needs.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## The Scientific Method helps with obtaining Mechanical Sympathy!

</Slide>
<Slide>

## It helps the Developer Experience

* Debug software more effectively by experimenting with different conditions
* Projects can make better scheduling decisions with a consistent framing
* Less change of feeling overwhelmed by a large task

</Slide>
<Slide>

## It helps the User Experience

* Systems of the future will need to come to where the user is.
* User feedback can be an input into the process of what to do next
* Performance engineering can become an effective part of the accessibility equation

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Aside: Evaluate your device testing as part of this

* Example: 75th percentiles ‚è≤Ô∏è
  * Mobile: Samsung A51 (or a Galaxy S7/8 - ish)
  * Desktop: 2 core 4 thread Skylake/Bulldozer, spinning HDDs!

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üí°Takeaway I: The most important time to save in *any* process or system is *people's* time

* This factors into UX, DX, processes around sprints, project delays, the works.
* There is no free lunch
* If you're slow/complicated/inaccessible, users will go elsewhere (or build it themselves)

</Slide>
<Slide>

## So... why not *"Biological Sympathy"* as well? üí™üèº

* People are just as much a part of these systems as the tech we're building
* Effective products are effective *because* they understand the needs of the people involved

</Slide>
<Slide>

## The Scientific method makes development more *sustainable*

* Small, frequent experiments helps with scheduling tasks effectively
* Updating has the potential to be *proactive* instead of *reactive*
* A problem can *almost always* be broken down to be smaller smaller
* Easier for someone to be onboarded into a project quickly and effectively.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Relevant Case Study: CVE-2024-3094 - `xz-utils`

* `xz-utils` was targeted via social engineering because it is a core project of Linux deployments maintained by one person.
* This led to a vulnerability being constructed on a specifically patched version of OpenSSH used by Debian/Red Hat distros.
* Fundamentally, the initial step is a *process* vulnerability.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## This is not the first time this has happened

* I don't have time to go into more details
  * [Sam James (`meson` maintainer) has a good summary if you want more information](https://gist.github.com/thesamesam/223949d5a074ebc3dce9ee78baad9e27)
* Heartbleed, in particular, did get short-term funding, but it didn't last.
* Long term solutions are needed, and they have to involve everyone as a community

</Slide>
<Slide>

## My Opinion: The industry's most pressing question is...

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üí°Takeaway II: "What can we do to make development practices more rigorous *and sustainable*?"

* Hint: I think a collective culture of learning from our past mistakes sounds pretty sciency!

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Answering questions on sustainable systems development is hard

* How do you get C-Level execs on board with this philosophy in the long term?
* Where could the industry improve?
* Who's being let down?

</Slide>
<Slide>

## A few partial answers/suggestions

* Consider supporting maintainers of projects you depend on
* Internal Developers: If they look to be burned out, do they need a judgement-free space (sabbaticals - ideally paid!) to recover?
* Are your clients/marketing contributing to crunch due to indecision or otherwise?
* Is your user feedback sufficient enough for you to be confident you're going in the right direction?

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Social engineering issues need to be solved in the long-term

* We already have security teams looking at the technical stuff
* This is a financial and mental health support problem, fundamentally
* I've used this structure of problems to improve my own mental health regarding my work
* A scaled up, industry-wide approach could work well.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Symptoms/Vulnerability precursors

* Maintainer burnout - it sucks, it's all too common, and I have a huge amount of respect for Lasse Collin.
* Processes where companies pressuring individuals being the norm
* The industry turning a blind eye to the funding gap between salaried employees and full-time FOSS devs.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Hypothesis: Lack of support led to the trust of a malicious actor

* Evidence: Attacker has been contributing and actively helping since 2021...
* No other financial or personnel support
* Maintainer is potentially vulnerable to parties attacking their mental health

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Collective Experiment proposal: Support the libraries you use

* Ask them how you can help contribute, especially if they're a small team
* Target your donations based on that team's needs
* If something is high priority to fix, pay them adequately and don't crunch them.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Aside: Employment

* Might seem simple, but
  * Can backfire if the dev in question is prevented from working on the project during company time
  * Often better to try and make a regular donation so they can go part time versus other work.

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Culture experiment: Evaluate your self-development culture

* Web Designers: Learn some HTML/CSS!
* Devs: Evaluate yourself against the next level's job spec.
* Project managers: Consider attending user feedback sessions
* Dev Leads: Consider how to delegate the role of Engineering Project Manager

</Slide>
<Slide>

## Everyone: Think like a scientist - Take notes

* I use Obsidian
  * Great Markdown features
  * Free for personal use
* Other methods might work also (hand written notes in particular)
* The more knowledge obtained, the more society benefits

</Slide>
<Slide>

## üí°Takeaway III: The best teams learn from one another, other teams, as a well as their users

</Slide>
<Slide>

## In short: The Scientific Method is a tool and philosophy that helps people think about their processes on a daily basis...

</Slide>
<Slide>

## It helps with learning new things, and forming new ideas...

</Slide>
<Slide>

## It serves me well, and I hope it serves you all well too!

</Slide>
<Slide>

## I'm looking forward to your own conclusions - keep me posted of your progress
